## Welcome to the DeepLabCut Organization!  👋

🙋‍♀️ DeepLabCut™ is an efficient method for 2D and 3D markerless pose estimation based on transfer learning with deep neural networks. 
- Our [main code repo is here](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut).
- 👩‍💻 [Read our documentation](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/intro.html) for how to get started and how to use DeepLabCut.

We also have several related code repositories that may be of interest:
 
 - [DLC-Live!](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut-live) & [DLC-Live! GUI](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut-live-GUI) -- export your trained DeepLabCut model and run it for live analysis. Consider using our easy GUI to do so.
 - [DLCUtils](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DLCutils) -- this repo hosts some code and key links to helper packages that input the outputs of DeepLabCut for downstream analysis. 
 - [DLC Workshop & Educational Materials](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut-Workshop-Materials) -- learn about how to use and develop with DeepLabCut!
 - [DLC2Kinematics](https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/DLC2Kinematics) -- use this code to load DeepLabCut (H5) files for movement analysis, dev. by MW Mathis Lab.
 - [DLC2Action](https://github.com/amathislab/DLC2action) -- for action segmentation based on pose estimation data, dev. by A Mathis Group.
 - [CEBRA](https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/CEBRA) -- use this code to load DeepLabCut (H5) files for advnced nonlinear embedding analysis and joint modeling, dev. by MW Mathis Lab.
